Inline has more priority then internal or external depending on which is written down

Also if same process is applied on one element i.e. either they have all 3 selectors OR same class is taken but with different class, then priority is given to that which is at bottom 
We have 3 selectors in CSS
1. Element Selector 2. Id 3. Class
B. An element can have more than 2 classes separeted by space like
<p class="green-text bold-h"> Para </p>  Now green-text is separate class and bold-h is separete classS
C. An element can have id and class at same time
D. If an element has all selectors then priority goes TO id then class then element
