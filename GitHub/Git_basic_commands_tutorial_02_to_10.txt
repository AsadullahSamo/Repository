pwd --> To see current working directory
cd /c --> to move to local disk C:     (same is true for E:)
git config --global user.name "Asad" (to change user name)
git config  user.name --> To see user name  (same for email)
git config --list  (to see list)

Tutorial #03   Three Stage Architecture

Commit:- A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.
Staging area:- These files are also referred to as "untracked files." Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit. The repository contains all of a project's commits.  (if we want that a file shouldn't go to next commit then don't put in stage) 

Tutorial #04   Tracking our first git project
git init --> to initialize git repository  (if you run it again it'll be reinitialized which we don't want) so always check git status before git init
git status --> to check status of git repository
git add --a  --> to add all Files to Staging Area
git commit -m "Initial commit"  --> To commit all files sent to Staging area
git log  --> To know which files you made commit
Now if we made changes to First.txt and Github Excel.xlsx and Saved (see git status and it will show which files you modified)
and we want to put only First.txt into staging area (because we may wanna work with .xslx file more) ,
then write--> git add First.txt

Tutorial #05  Cloning a remote git repository from github      (Remote= when taking something from internet)

rm -rf .git --> To delete a git repository
git clone url_here  folder_name--> To clone a repository from that source to our computer

Tutorial #07
touch file_name.extension --> To create a blank file
Let's say if we wanna ignore a file that is generating random erros, to do so first create file .gitignore by using
1. touch .gitignore     (and write file_name.extension of error generating file in .gitignore file, in this case write error.log in text document (.gitignore))
*  After that error generating file will no longer be tracked
2. if you wanna ignore all files with extension.log write, *.log , in .ignore file and save it 
3. and to ignore folder write, folder_name/ in .gitignore file and save
and if want just to ignore outer folder write, /dir/ in .gitignore file

Tutorial #08 

. git diff --> to see difference between working directory and staging area OR previous commit and staging area
. git diff --staged --> To see previously committed files and current staging area

Tutorial #09 :- Skipping The Staging Area 

. git commit -a -m "Direct Commit"  --> To commit while skipping staging area 

tutorial #10  Moving and renaming files in Git

. git rm third.txt   --> to remove third.txt
. git mv first.txt first_renamed.text   --> To rename first.txt to first_renamed.txt
. git rm --cached db.accdb    --> To untrack db.accdb so as to not track it
